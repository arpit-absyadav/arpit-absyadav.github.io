      <h2>Hello , Welcome to the jungle.</h2>
      <p class="capital">
        Are you ever really alone? Even when you think you are sitting at home
        alone, you are still in the company of a great number of living things.
        Bacteria live on you and in your body, and constantly protect you and
        also, occasionally, cause you to become ill. Mites that are spread
        everywhere, from the chair you sit in to your carpet, to the air you
        breathe. Moulds and fungi begin reproducing on foods left out in the
        open in your kitchen for even a few hours—all of these constitute a
        different world with its own unique lifestyles, nutritional systems and
        structural features.
